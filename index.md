Welcome to the home page of Dr. Andrew Sen, assistant professor in the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering at Marquette University.

My research advances structural engineering for natural hazards by developing the fundamental understanding of structural performance and creating tools to enable design and evaluation across academia and practice. My primary research lies at the intersection of structural steel design and earthquake engineering, where I have conducted (and continue to conduct) substantial work to enhance seismic design, retrofit, and repair of concentrically braced frames.
